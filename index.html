<h2> Apparently Visual Studio Code was supposed to save my work</h2>
Yeah..... that never happened so now i guess this is all you'll get
<a href="/about.html" > this</a> it's just what I can remember.

I'm apparently supposed to add new pages 
<h2><a href="/public/movie-ranking.html"> Like this movie page thing</a></h2>
Or maybe it was supposed to be like this?
<hr>
<img src="assets/images/movie-ranking.png" height="200" />

<h1>Here's another project </h1>
I wasn't aware we had a lesson on how to save our work, I've been winging it. 
It would be extremely useful though, testing my working memory with this course

<h2><a href="/public/birthday-invite.html">Happy Birthday</a></h2>

<a>Heres  a picture to show you something</a>
<hr>
<img src="./assets/images/birthday-invite.png" height="200">

<hr>
when did we learn ther hr would give us a new line?
ha I'm sure YOU knew that. 
But I'm pretty happy with all that I did remember considering it felt like this class flew by!
